## ABOUT THE PROJECT:
You just landed yourself a great deal and acquired a farm upcountry that has dairy cattle. These cows are well fed and they produce a fair amount of milk every day. Luckily, Brookside Dairies has also called you in, for yet another deal to sell your milk produce to them for processing. There's one problem though, you're very engaged in a website consultation company which leaves very little time for you to monitor milk production at your farm.

Your cows will make you rich if you monitor their milk production and sale, and you have skills to build a program with JavaScript, that helps you monitor production and sales. Here's a document of what you have on your farm. Assume that this is a day's production

Brookside Dairies has signed a contract with you to buy milk at Ksh.45 per litre for one year.:
